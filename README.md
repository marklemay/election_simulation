I made some scripts to simulate elections under different voting systems:

* Instant runoff better reflects voter preference better than plurality when there at 5 candidates
* Instant runoff and plurality perform about the same with 3 or fewer candidates.
* Approval performed best of the most popular proposed voting systems
* Rank choice can perform better with different resolution criteria
